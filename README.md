# CSharp-VisualStudio-Unity-R_TimeSerieswithAR
C#, Visual Studio, Unity, and R - Time Series with Augmented Reality - Visualisation of New Zealand GDP Data

Summary: The purpose of this project was to find the best way to represent New Zealandâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data across multiple regions and years, using Augmented Reality (AR). The outcome of this project is an AR visualisation prototype, created using Unity and built into an Android app. It is designed so that given: CSV files containing GDP data, a marker, and a device, one or more people could view that data from unique 3D perspectives not easily possible through other methods.

About the files: There are three folders as below. TimeSerieswithAR is the main folder, the other folders are for substitute versions in case the main one did not work well.

- TimeSerieswithAR: This folder is to easily see on github the work on data, C#, Visual Studio, and Unity.
  + The scripts are stored in this directory: TimeSerieswithAR/Assets/Scripts
  + The scence can also be used to open the works (if after downloading the folder, the unity would not work), and it could be found in this directory: TimeSerieswithAR/Assets/Scences/TimeSeriesAR.unity
  
- Unitypackage_TimeSerieswithAR: This folder is to download the unity package, then to import to your local unity (in case that the other folder would not work well on your machine).

- Zipfile_TimeSerieswithAR (full version): This folder contains the zip file, and this zip file includes:
  + Android package: Android_TimeSerieswithAR.apk
  + An instruction: PLEASE READ ME FIRST.docx
  + A report: Report-TimeSerieswithAR.docx
  + A unity package: TimeSerieswithAR.unitypackage
