C#, Visual Studio, Unity, and R - Time Series with Augmented Reality - Visualisation of New Zealand GDP Data

Summary: The purpose of this project was to New Zealandâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data across multiple regions and years, using Augmented Reality (AR) and predict the trends. The outcome of this project is an AR visualisation prototype, created using Unity and built into an Android app. It is designed so that given: CSV files containing GDP data, a marker, and a device, one or more people could view that data from unique 3D perspectives not easily possible through other methods.

Some pictures about the outcome of the projects:
